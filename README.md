## Css-Project (Simple website interfaceðŸ’») 

We were asked, during the first week of the summer training at Qassim Panorama Company, 
an individual task, which is to study and complete the Satr platform course [https://satr.codes/] on full stack JavaScript. 
We were asked to complete the first seven tracks of the course, which were
about (html, css, Bootstrap, DOM, JavaScript101-102-103 And sending the projects that are within each 
track after that (some tracks did not include projects), we were given a grace of 
five days to understand the course and send the projects.
