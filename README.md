## css-project

We were asked, during the first week of the summer training at Qassim Panorama Company, 
an individual task, which is to study and complete the Satr platform course [https://satr.codes/] on full stack JavaScript. 
We were asked to complete the first seven tracks of the course, which were
about (html, css, Bootstrap, DOM, JavaScript101-102-103 And sending the projects that are within each 
track after that (some tracks did not include projects), we were given a grace of 
five days to understand the course and send the projects.
